    <p>Having turned away from health and wellness, I have decided to pursue a career in technology. I'm looking to take on a
    role where I can further apply what I have learned at Pace University and develop with the company. I am interested in
    back-end and systems development, as well as data analysis and cybersecurity. I'm able to solve challenging problems in
    a team-based environment in order to develop new, working solutions, and I'm looking forward to testing my skills in a
    true workplace environment.</p>
