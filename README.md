# 100DaysofPython

This repository will be updated on a weekly basis throughout the 100 Days of Python challenge.

During this one hundred day challenge, I plan on learning new topics in Python and solve  problems with code.  Some of these topics include:
  * Building GUIs and Desktop Applications
  * Create websites and webapps using Python
  * Make simple games using Python
  * Explore modern Python frameworks (i.e. Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Beautiful Soup)

This repository is organized into folders by date. *For example*, the path to find Day 56 will be ```/50s/56```
